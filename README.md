> A light and Minimal CSS Library

[shoyo Docs](https://shoyo.sambitsahoo.com/)

# Motivation 

`shoyo` is primarily created for those developers who customize their project heavily without any huge css libraries like `Bootstrap`. shoyo adds a very basic styling for the developer to customize. It's a `developer friendly` library in a sense where customization is done primarily.

# Why ?

I'm a matured `Bootstrap` user and in my views It's great for the projects where the UI, Color, Feel and size is not a priority. It's ideal for fastrack projects. But after using Bootstrap for a long long duration, I realised that my projects are built upon heavily customized Bootstrap. So when I deployed my projects, they are slow with unused css and not to mention `jQuery`. So I thought of creating shoyo as a css library with the most basic styling for me to customize upon.

# Features

- Light weight
